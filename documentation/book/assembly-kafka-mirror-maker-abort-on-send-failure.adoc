= Abort Mirror Maker if message sending fails

You can control whether the Mirror Maker container is terminated if an error occurs when sending a message.
After the Mirror Maker container has been terminated, it is recreated on {ProductPlatformName}.
If the `abortOnSendFailure` option is set to `false`, message sending errors are ignored.
