= Zookeeper configuration

Zookeeper nodes are configured using the `config` property in `Kafka.spec.zookeeper`.
This property contains the Zookeeper configuration options as keys.
The values can be described using one of the following JSON types:

* String
* Number
* Boolean

Users can specify and configure the options listed in {ApacheZookeeperConfig} with the exception of those options which are managed directly by {ProductName}.
Specifically, all configuration options with keys equal to or starting with one of the following strings are forbidden:

* `server.`
* `dataDir`
* `dataLogDir`
* `clientPort`
* `authProvider`
* `quorum.auth`
* `requireClientAuthScheme`

When one of the forbidden options is present in the `config` property, it is ignored and a warning message is printed to the Custer Operator log file.
All other options are passed to Zookeeper.

IMPORTANT: The Cluster Operator does not validate keys or values in the provided `config` object.
When invalid configuration is provided, the Zookeeper cluster might not start or might become unstable.
In such cases, the configuration in the `Kafka.spec.zookeeper.config` object should be fixed and the Cluster Operator will roll out the new configuration to all Zookeeper nodes.

Selected options have default values:

* `timeTick` with default value `2000`
* `initLimit` with default value `5`
* `syncLimit` with default value `2`
* `autopurge.purgeInterval` with default value `1`

These options will be automatically configured when they are not present in the `Kafka.spec.zookeeper.config` property.
