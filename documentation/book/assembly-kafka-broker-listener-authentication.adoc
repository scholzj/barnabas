= Listener authentication

The listener `authentication` property is used to specify an authentication mechanism specific to that listener:

* Mutual TLS authentication (only on the listeners with TLS encryption)
* SCRAM-SHA authentication

If no `authentication` property is specified then the listener does not authenticate clients which connect through that listener.

Authentication must be configured when using the User Operator to manage `KafkaUsers`.
