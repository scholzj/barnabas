= Enabling the example Grafana dashboards

Set up a Prometheus data source and example dashboards to enable Grafana for monitoring.

NOTE: No alert notification rules are defined.

When accessing a dashboard, you can use the `port-forward` command to forward traffic from the Grafana pod to the host.

For example, you can access the Grafana user interface by:

. Running `kubectl port-forward grafana-1-fbl7s 3000:3000`
. Pointing a browser to `http://localhost:3000`

NOTE: The name of the Grafana pod is different for each user.

.Procedure

. Access the Grafana user interface using `admin/admin` credentials.
+
On the initial view choose to reset the password.

After importing the dashboards, the Grafana dashboard homepage presents Kafka and Zookeeper dashboards.

When the Prometheus server has been collecting metrics for a {ProductName} cluster for some time, the dashboards are populated.
