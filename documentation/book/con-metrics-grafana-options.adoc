= Grafana configuration

{ProductName} provides xref:ref-metrics-config-files-{context}[example configuration files for Grafana].

A Grafana docker image is provided for deployment:

* `grafana.yaml`

Example dashboards are also provided as JSON files:

* `strimzi-kafka.json`
* `strimzi-kafka-connect.json`
* `strimzi-zookeeper.json`

The example dashboards are a good starting point for monitoring key metrics, but they do not represent all available metrics.
You may need to modify the example dashboards or add other metrics, depending on your infrastructure.

For Grafana to present the dashboards, use the configuration files to:

* xref:proc-metrics-deploying-grafana-{context}[Deploy Grafana]
