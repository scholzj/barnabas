= Entity Operator

The Entity Operator is responsible for managing Kafka-related entities in a running Kafka cluster.

The Entity Operator comprises the:

* xref:assembly-getting-started-topic-operator-str[Topic Operator] to manage Kafka topics
* xref:assembly-getting-started-user-operator-str[User Operator] to manage Kafka users

Through `Kafka` resource configuration, the Cluster Operator can deploy the Entity Operator, including one or both operators, when deploying a Kafka cluster.

NOTE: When deployed, the Entity Operator contains the operators according to the deployment configuration.

The operators are automatically configured to manage the topics and users of the Kafka cluster.
