= Identifying a Kafka cluster for user handling

A `KafkaUser` resource includes a label that defines the appropriate name of the Kafka cluster (derived from the name of the `Kafka` resource) to which it belongs.

[source,yaml,subs="attributes+"]
----
apiVersion: {KafkaApiVersion}
kind: KafkaUser
metadata:
  name: my-user
  labels:
    strimzi.io/cluster: my-cluster
----

The label is used by the User Operator to identify the `KafkaUser` resource and create a new user, and also in subsequent handling of the user.

If the label does not match the Kafka cluster, the User Operator cannot identify the `kafkaUser` and the user is not created.
