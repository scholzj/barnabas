= Authorization

You configure authorization for Kafka brokers using the `authorization` property in the `Kafka.spec.kafka` resource.
If the `authorization` property is missing, no authorization is enabled.
When enabled, authorization is applied to all enabled xref:assembly-configuring-kafka-broker-listeners-{context}[listeners].
The authorization method is defined in the `type` field; only Simple authorization is currently supported. 

You can optionally designate a list of super users in the `superUsers` field.

== Simple authorization

Simple authorization in {ProductName} uses the `SimpleAclAuthorizer` plugin, the default Access Control Lists (ACLs) authorization plugin provided with Apache Kafka. ACLs allow you to define which users have access to which resources at a granular level.
To enable simple authorization, set the `type` field to `simple`.

== Super users

Super users can access all resources in your Kafka cluster regardless of any access restrictions defined in ACLs.
To designate super users for a Kafka cluster, enter a list of user principles in the `superUsers` field. 
If a user uses TLS Client Authentication, the username will be the common name from their certificate subject prefixed with `CN=`.

    - sam

NOTE: The `super.user` configuration option in the `config` property in `Kafka.spec.kafka` is ignored.
Designate super users in the `authorization` property instead.
