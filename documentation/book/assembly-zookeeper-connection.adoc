= Zookeeper connection

Zookeeper services are secured with encryption and authentication and are not intended to be used by external applications that are not part of {ProductName}.

However, if you want to use Kafka CLI tools that require a connection to Zookeeper, such as the `kafka-topics` tool, you can use a terminal inside a Kafka container and connect to the local end of the TLS tunnel to Zookeeper by using `localhost:2181` as the Zookeeper address.
