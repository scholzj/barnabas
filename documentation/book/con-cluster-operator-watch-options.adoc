= Watch options for a Cluster Operator deployment

When the Cluster Operator is running, it starts to _watch_ for updates of Kafka resources.

Depending on the deployment, the Cluster Operator can watch Kafka resources from:

* xref:deploying-cluster-operator-{context}[A single namespace (the namespace it is installed)]
* xref:deploying-cluster-operator-to-watch-multiple-namespaces{context}[Multiple namespaces]
* xref:deploying-cluster-operator-to-watch-whole-cluster-{context}[All namespaces]

NOTE: {ProductName} provides example YAML files to make the deployment process easier.

The Cluster Operator watches the following resources:

* `Kafka` for the Kafka cluster.
* `KafkaConnect` for the Kafka Connect cluster.
* `KafkaConnectS2I` for the Kafka Connect cluster with Source2Image support.
* `KafkaMirrorMaker` for the Kafka Mirror Maker instance.
* `KafkaBridge` for the Kafka Bridge instance

When one of these resources is created in the Kubernetes cluster, the operator gets the cluster description from the resource and starts creating a new cluster for the resource by creating the necessary Kubernetes resources, such as StatefulSets, Services and ConfigMaps.

Each time a Kafka resource is updated, the operator performs corresponding updates on the Kubernetes resources that make up the cluster for the resource.

Resources are either patched or deleted, and then recreated in order to make the cluster for the resource reflect the desired state of the cluster. This operation might cause a rolling update that might lead to service disruption.

When a resource is deleted, the operator undeploys the cluster and deletes all related Kubernetes resources.
