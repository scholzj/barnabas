= Deploying the Cluster Operator to watch a single namespace

.Prerequisites

* This procedure requires use of a Kubernetes user account which is able to create `CustomResourceDefinitions`, `ClusterRoles` and `ClusterRoleBindings`. 
Use of Role Base Access Control (RBAC) in the Kubernetes cluster usually means that permission to create, edit, and delete these resources is limited to Kubernetes cluster administrators, such as `system:admin`. 
* Modify the installation files according to the namespace the Cluster Operator is going to be installed in.
